# MegaMek Extras
This repository contains additional resources for [MegaMek, MekHQ, and MegaMekLab](https://megamek.org), such as camouflage and character portraits. It is meant to be a drag and drop setup, unless specified below.

Currently, the pack contains:
* Unused Sprites - Many of the old sprites and unshaded sprites Deadborder has made have been added here. This is not a complete history, but rather just images added when expec6t
* Camo - a variety of camo-packs from various contributors over the years.
* Portraits - a copy/paste-able setup for portraits. Currently only contains ink effect portraits, as done by Feenix74 and explained [here](https://forum.megamek.org/showthread.php?tid=555).
    * Female:
        * BW: Contains Black and White Ink Effect Portraits
        * Colour: Contains Coloured Ink Effect Portraits 
    * Male:
        * BW: Contains Black and White Ink Effect Portraits
        * Colour: Contains Coloured Ink Effect Portraits 

The repository has the same directory structure as for the main programs so releases can be directly extracted into the main application directory.

More information on contributors for these various resources will hopefully be made available in the future.
